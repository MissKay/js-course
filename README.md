# JavaScript for Teenagers

This is the curriculum I used to teach JavaScript programming to Bay Area teenagers.

The first week we learned JavaScript basics by looking at syntax and data types.

The second week we learned how to build simple programs using functions. We predominantly used HTML5's canvas to illustrate how to use functions and data types to create simple illustrations.

The third week we looked at the DOM and how JavaScript is used to add interactivity to DOM elements through event listeners.
